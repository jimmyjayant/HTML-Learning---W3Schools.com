            Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.

            What is Multimedia? 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more. 
            <br>
            Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>
            Browser Support 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color. 
            <br>
            Later came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedia! 
        </p>

        <h2>
            Multimedia Formats 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files. 
            <br>
            The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension. 
            <br>
            Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.
