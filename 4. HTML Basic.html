<h1>
    HTML Basic Examples 
</h1>

<br>

<p>
    In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples. 
    <br>
    Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet. 
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
    HTML Documents 
</h2>

<br>

<p>
    All HTML Documents must start with a document type declaration: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. 
    <br>
    The HTML document itself begins with &lt;html&gt; and ends with &lt;/html&gt;. 
    <br>
    The visible part of the HTML document is between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;.

<h2>
    The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; Declaration 
</h2>

<br>

<p>
    The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. 
    <br>
    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags). 
    <br>
    The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration is not case sensitive. 
    <br>
    The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration for HTML5 is:- 
    <br>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
    HTML Headings 
</h2>

<br>

<p>
HTML headings are defined with the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags. 
<br>
&lt;h1&gt; defines the most important heading. &lt;h6&gt; defines the least important heading. 
<br>

<br>
</p>

<br>

<h1>This is Heading 1.</h1>
<h2>This is Heading 2.</h2>
<h3>This is Heading 3.</h3>
<h4>This is Heading 4.</h4>
<h5>This is Heading 5.</h5>
<h6>This is Heading 6.</h6>


<br>
<br>

<h2>
    HTML Paragraphs 
</h2>

<br>

<p>
    HTML paragraphs are defined with the &lt;p&gt; tag:- 
    <br>
    Example:- 
    <br>
</p>

<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
<p>This is another paragraph. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
    HTML Links 
</h2>

<br>

<p>
    HTML Links are defined with the &lt;a&gt; tag:- 
    <br>
    Example:- 
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>

    <br>
    <br>

    The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
    <br>
    Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. 
    <br>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
    HTML Images 
</h2>

<br>

<p>

    How to View HTML Source

</h3>

<br>
<p>
Right-click in a HTML page and select "View Page Source" (in Chrome) or "View Source" (in Edge), or similar in other browsers. This will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page. 
</p>

</h3>
