        </h1>

        <p>
            HTML Comments are not displayed in the browsers, but they can help document your HTML source code. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            HTML Comment Tag 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            You can add comments to your HTML source code by using the following syntax:- 
            <br>
            <p style="color:green;">&lt;!--Write your comments here--&gt;</p>
            <br>
            Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Add Comments 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            With Comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <!--This is a comment-->
            <p>This is a paragraph. </p>
            <!--Reminder to add more information here-->

        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Hide Content 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Comments can be used to hide content. 
            <br>
            This can be useful if you hide content temporarily:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <!-- <p>This is another paragraph. -->
                <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                You can hide more than one line. Everything between the &lt;!-- and the --&gt; will be hidden from display. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Comments are also great for debugging HTML, but you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Hide Inline Content 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            Hide a part of a paragraph:- 
            <br>
            <p>This is <!--a great--> paragraph.</p>
        </p>
    </body>
