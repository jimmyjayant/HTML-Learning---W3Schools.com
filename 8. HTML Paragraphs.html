        <h1>
            HTML Paragraphs 
        </h1>

        <br>

        <p>
            A Paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            HTML Paragraphs 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            The HTML &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph. 
            <br>
            A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically adds some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            HTML Display 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. 
            <br>
            Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results. 
            <br>
            With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding some extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. 
            <br>
            The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and the lines when the page is displayed:- 
            <br>
            &lt;p&gt; 
            <br>
            This paragraph 
            <br>
            contains a lot of lines 
            <br>
            in the source code, 
            <br>
            but the browser 
            <br>
            ignores it. 
            <br>
            &lt;/p&gt; 
            <br>
            The above paragraph will be displayed as below in the browser:- 
            <br>
            <p>
                This paragraph 
                contains a lot of lines 
                in the source code, 
                but the browser 
                ignores it. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            &lt;p&gt; 
            <br>
            This paragraph 
            <br>
            contains&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot of spaces 
            <br>
            in the source&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code, 
            <br>
            but the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;browser 
            <br>
            ignores it. 
            <br>
            &lt;/p&gt; 

            <br>
            <br>

            The above paragraph will be displayed as below in the browser:- 
            <br>
            <p>
                This paragraph 
                contains           a lot of spaces 
                in the source           code, 
                but the             browser 
                ignores it.

        <h2>
            HTML Horizontal Rules 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            The &lt;hr&gt; tag defines a thematic break in the HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. 
            <br>
            The &lt;hr&gt; element is used to separate content (or define a change) in the HTML page:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <h1>This is heading 1.</h1>
            <p>
                This is some text.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>This is heading 2.</h2>
            <p>
                This is some other text. 
            </p>
            <hr>

            <br>
            <br>

            The &lt;hr&gt; tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            HTML Line Breaks 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            The HTML &lt;br&gt; element defines a line break. 
            <br>
            Use &lt;br&gt; if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p>
                This is <br>a paragraph <br>with line breaks.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            The &lt;br&gt; tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            The Poem Problem 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            In HTML, spaces and new lines will be ignored. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            &lt;p&gt; 
            <br>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My Bonnie lies over the sea. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh, Bring back my Bonnie to me. 
            <br>
            &lt;/p&gt; 
            <br>
            <br>
            The above poem will be displayed as below in the browser:- 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 

                
                My Bonnie lies over the sea. 

                
                My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 

                
                Oh, Bring back my Bonnie to me. 
            </p>
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Solution - The HTML &lt;pre&gt; Element 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            The HTML &lt;pre&gt; element defines preformatted text. 
            <br>
            The text inside a &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <pre>
                My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 


                My Bonnie lies over the sea. 




                My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 




                Oh, Bring back my Bonnie to me.
            </pre>
