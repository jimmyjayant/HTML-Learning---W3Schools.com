        <p>
            A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.

        <h2>
            What is a Web Worker? 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            When executing scripts in a HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished. 
            <br>
            A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Web Worker on a Single Threaded vs Multi Threaded System 
        </h2>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            In a multi threaded system, the web page or the main html page runs on the main thread. While the web worker runs on the another thread in parallel and asynchronously. 
            <br>
            But, what if the system is single threaded? Then in this case, it might seem that the web worker would not be able to execute in parallel as they do on multi-threaded or multi-core systems. 
            <br>
            But they do run on single threaded system and in this manner:- 
            <br>
            Web worker can still be created, but they do not execute in parallel in traditional sense. Instead, the browser uses a technique called <b>Context Switching</b>. 
            <br>
            The main web page and the web worker still run in separate execution contexts, even though they share the same single core. 
            <br>
            The main page sends messages to the Web worker and vice-versa, but both threads are still executed <b>sequentially</b> in a time-sliced manner. 
            <br>
            The operating system can switch between the main page and web worker rapidly, giving the illusion of concurrency. 
            <br>
            The web worker on a single threaded system might not provide as much performance as on a multi-threaded system. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Before creating a web worker, check whether the user's browser supports it:- 
            <br>
            <p style="border:1px solid grey;padding:10px;">
            <span style="color:blue;">if</span> (<span style="color:blue;">typeof</span>(Worker)!==<span style="color:brown;">"undefined"</span>) 
            <br>
            {
                <br>
                <span style="color:green;">// Yes! Web worker support!</span> 
                <br>
                <span style="color:green;">//<i> Some code...</i></span>
                <br>
            }

            <br>

                <br>
            }
            </p>

        <h2>
            Create a Web Worker File 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Now, let's create our web worker in an external JavaScript. 
            <br>
            Here, we create a script that counts. The script is stored in the "demo_workers.js" file:- 
            <br>
            <p style="border:1px solid grey;padding:10px;">
            <span style="color:blue;">var</span> i = <span style="color:red;">0</span>;
            <br>
            <span style="color:blue;">function</span> timedCount()
            <br>
            {
                <br>
                i = i + <span style="color:red;">1</span>;
                <br>
                postMessage(i);
                <br>
                setTimeout(<span style="color:brown;">"timedCount()"</span>,<span style="color:red;">500</span>);
                <br>
            }
            <br>
            timedCount();
            </p>
            <br>
            The important part of the code above is the <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">postMessage()</span> method - which is used to post a message back to the HTML page. 
            <br>
            <strong>Note:- </strong>Normally web workers are not used for such simple scripts, but for more CPU intensive tasks. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's say that w, z are the web workers. And we want to send data or message to these web workers from html page. 
            <br>
            Then, we will use the postMessage() method in the following manner:- 
            <br>
            w.postMessage(dataToSend);
            <br>
            z.postMessage(dataToSend);

            <br>
            Then, we will use the <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">postMessage()</span> method in the following manner:-

            postMessage(dataToSend);

            OR

            self.postMessage(dataToSend);
            <br>
            <br>
            In the context of web worker, <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">self</span> refers to the global context of worker thread itself. It is essentially the same as <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">this</span> would be in the main thread, but it's used specifically to refer to the global object in a worker. 
            <br>
            Because in web worker, the global object is <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">self</span>, since the worker does not have access to the <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">DOM</span> or the <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">window</span> object.

            w.onmessage = function(event) { // Code};
            <br>
            w.onmessage is an event listener to handle messages sent back from the worker. The data sent back is accessed via <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">event.data</span>.

            <br>
            The following lines checks if the worker already exists, if not - it creates a new web worker object and runs the code in "demo_workers.js":- 
            <br>
            <p style="border:1px solid grey;padding:10px;">

            Then we send and receive messages from the web worker. 
            <br>
            Add an "onmessage" event listener to the web worker. 
            <br>
            <p style="border:1px solid grey;padding:10px;">
            w.onmessage = function(event)

            <br>
            When the web worker posts a message, the code within the event listener is executed. The data from the web worker is stored in event.data.

            To terminate a web worker, and free browser/computer resources, use the <span style="color:red;background-color:#f1f1f1;">terminate()</span> method:-
